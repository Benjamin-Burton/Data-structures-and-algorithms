    // quick-union (lazy approach)
    // union was too expensive - now we want to speed it up. 
    // we can do this by way of a new data structure interpretation - a tree.

    // Interpretation if id[]: id[i] references the parent of index of i.
    // Root of i is id[id[id[id[...]]]] until it doesn't change. (is its own parent.)
    // Interpretation of sz
    // This keeps track of the NUMBER OF OBJECTS in each component.

    // this is also too slow in the worst case - because the trees can get really tall,
    // find is too expensive

    // This is the first improvement:
    // We track the depth of the trees on union, and keep them flat by attached the smaller one
    // to the root of the bigger one

    // algorithm initialize union find
    // quick-find N N 1
    // quick-union N N â€  N
    // weighted-QU N lg(N) lg(N)

    // This improves both union and find to log(N), which is an incredible improvement.
    // But we can improve further!
    // We can use path compression as well
    // "just after computing the root of p, set the id of each examined node to point to that root"

    // this has fascinating mathematical properties
    // in principle (theory), it is not a linear operation, but in practice, it is linear

    // Fredman-saks has proven (how??) that *no* linear time implementation exists.
